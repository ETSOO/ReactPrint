# @etsoo/reactprint
This project is cloned from https://github.com/gregnb/react-to-print in a rush. We are happy to merge the changes when the author is happy with.

# What major changes did we make:
- Add a new property called "pageSize" to render content in a controllable size for better print output.
- Simplified the project and tiny syntax changes.
